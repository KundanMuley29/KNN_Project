# KNN Classification

##  Overview
This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm** in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The KNN algorithm is a simple yet effective machine learning technique used for classification problems.

## Features
- Implementation of KNN from scratch and using `sklearn`
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics
